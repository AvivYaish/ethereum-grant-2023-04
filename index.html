    <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
    <p style="text-align:left;">
        In this grant proposal, we aim to build on our existing work and contribute to the security of the decentralized
        finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Leveraging our previous work (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13035">https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13035</a>),
        we will expand our dataset and refine the reference framework to systematically categorize and evaluate DeFi
        incidents and potential defenses. Our project will focus on investigating bytecode detection, rescue time frame,
        emergency pause mechanisms, and other novel defense mechanisms based on our expanded dataset.
    </p><br/>

    <p style="text-align:left;">
        This project makes significant contributions to the Ethereum and DeFi ecosystem by enhancing the security of
        DeFi protocols. With the rapid growth and increasing complexity of DeFi protocols, security has become a
        critical issue. The refined reference framework and novel defense mechanisms developed in this project will
        enable the development of more secure and robust DeFi protocols. By making our dataset open-source and
        accessible to the wider community, we aim to promote further research in this area. We intend to present the
        results and findings through talks and visualizations to make them accessible to a wider audience. Ultimately,
        this proposal will help to increase confidence in the DeFi ecosystem and provide a more secure platform for
        users to participate in DeFi activities.

        <h5>
            What are you hoping to accomplish with this grant?
        </h5>

        <p>The grant proposal aims to achieve the following objectives:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                We will expand the DeFi incident dataset to cover the period up to 2023, in order to include a more
                diverse range of incidents, academic papers, and security audit reports.
            </li>
            <li>
                Develop a refined reference framework to systematically categorize and evaluate DeFi incidents and
                potential defenses.
            </li>
            <li>
                Further explore bytecode detection, rescue time frame and emergency pause mechanisms, and other novel
                defense mechanisms based on the expanded dataset. Measure the effectiveness of the proposed defense
                mechanisms and identify any gaps that need further research.
            </li>
            <li>
                Visualize and disseminate the results and dataset to the broader academic and practitioner communities
                to facilitate further research and the development of more secure and robust DeFi protocols.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>
            How do you define and measure success for this project?
        </h5>

        <p>We define success for this project as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The expanded dataset and reference framework should provide a more comprehensive understanding of the
                security landscape of the DeFi ecosystem, including the most common types of DeFi incidents and
                potential defense mechanisms.
            </li>
            <li>
                The proposed defense mechanisms should demonstrate measurable improvements in security against known and
                unknown DeFi incidents.
            </li>
            <li>
                The results and dataset should be widely disseminated and adopted by the academic and practitioner
                communities, leading to the development of more secure and robust DeFi protocols.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h2 id="services">Outcomes</h2>

        <h5>How does this project benefit the greater Ethereum ecosystem?</h5>

        <p style="text-align:left;">
            This project's outcomes will provide a better understanding of the security landscape of the DeFi ecosystem,
            identify the most common types of DeFi incidents, evaluate potential defense mechanisms, and develop a
            refined reference framework and novel defense mechanisms. These outcomes will enable the development of more
            secure and robust DeFi protocols and increase confidence in the DeFi ecosystem.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:left;">
            Additionally, the open-source dataset and visualization tools will make it easier for future researchers to
            extend the dataset and conduct further research in the area.
        </p>

        <h2 id="scope">Grant Scope</h2>

        <h5>What are you going to research?</h5>

        <p style="text-align:left;">
            This grant proposal aims to expand the dataset of DeFi incidents on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
            to 2023, including a wider range of incidents, academic papers, and security audit reports. The project will
            investigate potential defense mechanisms, such as bytecode detection, rescue time frame and emergency pause
            mechanisms, and other novel defense mechanisms based on the expanded dataset.
        </p>

        <h5>What is the expected output?</h5>

        <p style="text-align:left;">
            The expected output of the project is a refined reference framework that systematically categorizes and
            evaluates DeFi incidents and potential defenses on all DeFi enabled blockchains. The research will also
            provide a more comprehensive understanding of the security landscape of the DeFi ecosystem on both chains,
            and the results will enable the development of more robust and secure DeFi protocols on Ethereum and Binance
            Smart Chain.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:left;">
            The output of this grant will also be an open-source dataset, visualization tools. We will also publish
            research papers, present our findings at conferences, and give talks to advertise the results and make them
            more accessible to the wider community.

        <h2 id="scope">Methodology</h2>

        <h5>How do you plan to achieve your research objectives?</h5>

        <p style="text-align:left;">
        To achieve our research objectives, we plan to use a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods. The initial phase of the project will involve an extensive review of existing literature on DeFi incidents, including academic papers, security audit reports, and other relevant sources. We will use this review to develop a comprehensive reference framework for DeFi incidents and potential defenses.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:left;">
        We will then expand our dataset of DeFi incidents to include a wider range of incidents, academic papers, and security audit reports by at least six months. We will use this expanded dataset to investigate advanced byte code detection, rescue time frame and emergency pause mechanisms, and other novel defense mechanisms.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:left;">
        To measure the effectiveness of our defense mechanisms, we will conduct experiments to simulate attacks on DeFi protocols using our expanded dataset. We will use this data to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed defense mechanisms and to identify areas for improvement.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:left;">
        Finally, we plan to make our dataset open-source and more accessible to the wider community by giving talks and advertising our results. We intend to visualize everything beautifully so that future research can easily extend our dataset.
        </p>
